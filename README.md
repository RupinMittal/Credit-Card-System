# Credit Card System

### Description

This was a project to learn about C programming. The following concepts were implemented:

* Pointers to Functions + Callback Functions
* External Variables
* Header Files
* Linking Multiple C Files
* Macro + Conditional Substitution
* Multidimensional Arrays
* Pointers + Pointers to Arrays
* Structs + Arrays of Structs
* Sorting + Quicksort
* Recursion
* File Input/Output (formatted)
* User Input/Output (formatted)
* Random Generation

This project randomly generates a credit card record with amounts, dates, locations and stores 
it in an array of structures (each struct represents a transaction). The user is given menu options 
that allows them to print their record to the screen, or to a Record.txt file, sort by date (in both 
old-->new and new-->old directions), sort by amount (in both low-->high and high-->low directions), 
add a transaction, or leave the program.

### How it works
